#Exploring prototypes with Git

This is a simple example of how Git can be used to A/B test responsive design layouts using branches in Git.

##To use:
Open the example using GitHub for Windows (or use your commandline tools)

- Run the master branch
- Resize the browser to see how the layout adapts to mobile
- Do not close the browser or stop the webserver
- Change branches to MobileLayoutA
- Refresh your browser
- Examine how the layout changes
- Repeat this process until you have seen all of the layouts

Using this technique you can make quick comparisons and decisions.

Once you decide which layout is best, the ideal layout can be merged back in to the master branch and the remaining layout branches can be deleted.

###Requirements
